# Diabetes Diagnosis React App

The **Diabetes Diagnosis React App** is a web application designed to assist users in predicting diabetes risk based on inputted health data. The application features a user-friendly interface built with React.js, allowing users to input their health information through a form submission process. Additionally, users can view the history records of past diagnoses.

### Features

- **Form Submission**: Users can input various health metrics such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, etc., through a form submission process.
  
- **Diagnosis History**: The application maintains a record of past diagnoses, allowing users to track their health trends over time.

### Machine Learning Model

The prediction of diabetes risk is powered by a machine learning model developed using Python. The model is deployed as a Flask API endpoint, enabling seamless integration with the React.js frontend. Currently, the application employs a baseline logistic regression model for prediction purposes.

### Technologies Used

- **Framework**: React.js
- **API Endpoint**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: Python, scikit-learn
